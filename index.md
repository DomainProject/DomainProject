The research project "DOMAIN: Taming Heterogeneous Computing Complexity with Full-Stack Governance of Domain-Specific Languages" aims to address the growing complexity in computing hardware architectures. With the transition to heterogeneous systems combining general-purpose and specialized computing units, the project focuses on developing high-level, semantically-rich abstractions that are accessible and efficient for domain experts across various fields. By exploring Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and creating new compiling toolchains, software runtime environments, and operating system supports, the project seeks to optimize large-scale heterogeneous platforms. The goal is to allow domain experts to efficiently code applications, leveraging the full potential of these complex architectures with minimal technical involvement.
