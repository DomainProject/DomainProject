We are thrilled to announce the commencement of our groundbreaking research project, "DOMAIN: Taming Heterogeneous
Computing Complexity with Full-Stack Governance of Domain-Specific Languages." This initiative marks a significant
milestone in our journey towards revolutionizing the landscape of computing.

As we embark on this ambitious project, our focus is firmly set on addressing the complexities inherent in the rapidly
evolving field of heterogeneous computing. The modern computing world is characterized by an intricate blend of CPUs,
GPUs, and specialized processors, each offering unique capabilities and efficiencies. Our goal is to harness this
diversity and create a seamless, efficient, and accessible computing environment.

The DOMAIN project is built on the foundation of innovation and excellence. We aim to develop advanced Domain-Specific
Languages (DSLs) that provide intuitive, high-level programming abstractions. These languages will empower developers to
leverage the full potential of heterogeneous systems without the need for in-depth knowledge of the underlying hardware
intricacies.

Our approach is holistic, encompassing the development of innovative compiling toolchains and runtime environments, as
well as enhancing operating system support for these complex platforms. We aspire to optimize performance, improve
resource allocation, and ensure that applications not only run efficiently but also effectively utilize the full
capabilities of the hardware.

As we move forward, we are committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in computing. The DOMAIN project is
not just about technological advancement; it's about creating a future where the complexity of computing becomes a
source of strength and innovation, rather than a barrier.

Stay tuned for updates as we navigate this exciting journey, breaking new ground and setting new standards in the world
of computing.
