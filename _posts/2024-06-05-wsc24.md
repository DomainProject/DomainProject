We are pleased to announce that our paper, "Model-Driven Engineering for High-Performance Parallel Discrete Event Simulations on Heterogeneous Architectures," has been accepted for presentation at the Winter Simulation Conference 2024. This research marks a significant advancement in the field of high-performance computing and simulation.

The paper explores the utilization of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) to simplify the development and execution of simulation models on heterogeneous architectures, which include CPUs, GPUs, and other specialized processors. Traditional approaches to simulation on these complex systems require extensive manual coding and optimization for each type of processor. Our approach leverages MDE to automate much of this process, allowing simulationists to focus on the model itself rather than the intricacies of the hardware.

The key goal of our research is to demonstrate how MDE can streamline the creation of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) that are optimized for heterogeneous computing environments. By using MDE-generated models with a state-of-the-art runtime environment, we show substantial improvements in the efficiency and scalability of parallel discrete event simulations.

Our results indicate that this method not only reduces the development time but also enhances the performance and energy efficiency of large-scale simulations. This innovative approach holds great promise for advancing the capabilities of simulation technology, making it more accessible and powerful for a wide range of applications.

We look forward to presenting our findings at the Winter Simulation Conference 2024 and engaging with the community to further explore the potential of MDE in high-performance computing.
