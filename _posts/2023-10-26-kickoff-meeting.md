We are excited to share that the DOMAIN project has officially kicked off with an inaugural meeting, marking the
beginning of a journey towards exceptional achievements in the field of heterogeneous computing. This event not only
served as a platform for collaboration and discussion but also led to the establishment of our low-level technical
goals, setting a clear and focused direction for our research endeavors.

During the kickoff meeting, our team of dedicated researchers and developers came together to align our visions and
strategies for the project. It was an opportunity to delve deep into the technical aspects of DOMAIN, ensuring that
every member is on the same page regarding our objectives and methodologies.

A significant outcome of this meeting was the setting of specific, low-level technical goals. These goals are the
building blocks of our project, defining the path we will take to achieve our larger objectives. We have outlined clear
targets in the development of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), optimizing compiling toolchains, and enhancing runtime
environments and operating system support. These goals are not just ambitious; they are meticulously crafted to address
the intricate challenges posed by heterogeneous computing systems.

Our team is now fully geared up to tackle these challenges head-on. We are motivated by the potential impact of our work
and driven by the passion for pushing the boundaries of computing technology. The kickoff meeting was not just a start;
it was a leap into a future where the complexities of heterogeneous computing are transformed into opportunities for
innovation and advancement.

As the DOMAIN project progresses, we will continue to share updates and insights into our journey. Stay tuned for more
as we embark on this exciting endeavor, breaking new ground in the world of computing.
